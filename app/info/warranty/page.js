      <Typography>
        Vita, Inc. warrants its products against defects in materials and
        workmanship for a period of ten (10) years from the date of original
        purchase. Exclusions to this warranty include decorative finishes, wood
        barres, and damage caused by abuse or misuse outside the range of normal
        usage. This warranty also does not cover damage due to accident,
        negligence, or modification of any part of the product.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        This warranty is in effect to the original purchaser only. In the
        unlikely event of a warranty claim, the purchaser is responsible for
        obtaining a Return Authorization Number (RMA) from Vita, Inc. and
        shipping the defective unit prepaid to the address shown on the RMA.
        Product must be packaged in its original packaging or packaging
        affording an equal degree of protection.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Vita, Inc. will repair or replace the defective unit and ship prepaid
        back to purchaser. Vita, Inc. reserves the right to select return
        shipping carrier and method. At its option, Vita, Inc. may replace
        defective unit with a replacement unit that is considered equal or
        superior to defective unit.

      <Typography>
        Repair or replacement as provided under this warranty is the exclusive
        remedy of the consumer. Vita, Inc., its parent company, affiliates or
        subsidiaries, shall not be liable for any incidental or consequential
        damages for breach of any expressed or implied warranty on this product.
        Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, any implied warranty
        or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose on this product
        is limited in duration to the duration of this warranty.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
        consequential damages or allow limitation on how long an implied
        warranty lasts, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply.
        This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may have other
        rights which vary from state to state. Use of this product constitutes
        acceptance of these terms and conditions of warranty.
