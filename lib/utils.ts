I only drank half, and soon after I got an instant burst of energy. No jitters, (even on an empty stomach) and it had me moving all morning! I love that it‚Äôs all natural. End it actually helped me decrease my appetite right up until the afternoon. I feel that this will also assist me with my goal of losing a few pounds. I will definitely be buying more of this in the future! I highly recommend. üëçüëç‚Äù`,

    title: 'LIKE MOST ENERGY SHOTS BUT WITH A HEALTHIER SOURCE OF ENERGY.',
    subtitle: `‚ÄúThese are powered with Yerba Mate, which is one of a few botanical sources of caffeine that is definitely smoother than caffeine from coffee beans. Yerba Mate is a very popular beverage in South America, and is their favorite source of caffeine. It is usually prepared and consumed from a gourd made beverage cup. As a big consumer of all things caffeine, I wanted to explore some of the alternatives. While I am not giving up my coffee just yet, there are noticeable differences and benefits from the alternative types of caffeine. There is definitely less jitters and less post use crash. This is an excellent way to try an energy boost shot with an alternative source of energy.‚Äù`,

    subtitle: `‚ÄúI had a day where I was so very groggy. I felt lethargic. I wanted to put these to the test to see if they helped. I actually perked up afterward. The flavor is something you want to get past. It‚Äôs not BAD in a way that you want to spit it out, but bad in that you want to get it down as fast as possible and move on with your life. I also had a tough time opening one of the bottles. Nobody could get it open. I used a pair of pliers and still had a hard time. The machine at the factory may have gone a little too hard on sealing that one. I like the drink. The flavor‚Ä¶ not so much.‚Äù`,
